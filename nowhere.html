		Worlding piece I created for my final year project at Goldsmiths University. It has existed in multiple forms: a downloadable game, an immersive, meditative space which ran at Goldsmiths in May 2023 and an interactive film at Thin Air, Beams in June 2023. It's blurb is:  
		<br>
		<br>
		This is Nowhere Actually Existing, and at it’s core, it is exactly that. It a digital worldbuilding piece illustrating a place that doesn’t exist, and won’t ever exist. It is a world that solely comes from my head and my imagination, embodying ideas of simulation being a presentation of a person’s perception of reality, originally coming from game designer Doris C. Rusch. Furthermore, it depicts an idyllic, sustainable community, with animals running around freely and wildly, depicting a Utopia, and in particular, my utopia, as it is my perception of reality. The name in particular comes from the book The Village Against The World which discusses the village and enhabitants of Marinaleda in Spain who created a ‘Utopia’ and a foundation for a cooperative way of life. However, this world is only a simulation. However perfect it may present as, it has it's flaws and it calls on you to find them. This utopia isn’t real, and will assure you you’re aware of it.

		This piece ran live at Goldsmiths University's SIML space and then at The Beams, both in London. The Goldsmith's version removed the interactivity from the piece, whilst at Beams a limited amount of interaction was added back in to create an interactive film by providing some audience members with an Xbox controller to change the scenery across the screens. Both versions included sound from VenAur, which was created with Pure Data. Here Vendela (VenAur) speaks on the collaboration: 
	</p>
		<div id="quoted">
			<p> In parallel with the visuals of the digital worldbuilding piece "This is Nowhere Actually Existing," I crafted an accompanying audio landscape that harmoniously complemented the visual elements. The audio was created using Pure Data and consisted of layer of ambience which was created using techniques such as the manipulation of noise and phasors. Drawing inspiration from the nature portrayed in the visuals, I crafted a composition that intertwines tranquility, excitement, and subtle elements wind. By integrating the auditory and visual elements, our collaboration aimed to transport the audience to a realm that blurs the boundaries between reality and imagination, inviting them to explore the simulated utopia.</p>
